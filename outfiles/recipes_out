(Like the original recipe we adapted, the method that worked best for us was to cut each half peel in half (to make a quarter) and flatten it, then we scraped the pith with a sharp knife from the middle of the peel to each tip. You can do this process with the lemon peels if you wish, or just the mandarin peels.',
                                         u'Once the pith is removed, slice the peels into thin julienne strips. As you cut the strips, place them into a large, heavy-bottomed pot.',

(NOTE: If that liquid is thick and gelatinous \u2013 then you likely will not need to add any powdered pectin to your cooked marmalade. If there is no noticeable thickening of the liquid, the powdered pectin will probably be necessary in Step 9 below.)

Then use your wooden spoon and \u201cdraw\u201d a line through the mixture. If it wrinkles, additional pectin isn\u2019t necessary.

In food service, we would cook the corned beef the day prior, place in the cooler with a heavy weight on top and the next day, any grains of heavy fat intermingled throughout the meat would be squeezed out yielding a less fatty looking slice. To do this at home and to show the difference, I cut the cooked roast in half and left one un-pressed and pressed the other by putting a second sheet pan over the top and topping with a heavy Dutch oven filled with some water. That whole set up is then placed in the refrigerator overnight. This step is not totally necessary but I wanted to show the difference.

Then with your thumb or index finger, scrape the seeds from each half into the bowl with the strainer. If cutting larger round tomatoes, cut out core and cut them horizontally. Then over the bowl with the strainer, reach up and scrape out all the seeds. Throw the cleaned tomatoes into the bowl without the strainer. Finally move the seeds around the strainer to get out any last bit of juice and discard seeds. Take the liquid left in the bowl and add to the tomato halves.
