After three hours, let sit in water off burner for 15 minutes then remove to a sheet tray. The spice bag mix does not get used while the corned beef is cooking. Corned beef has enough flavor on its own and you want the taste of the meat to shine.",

In food service, we would cook the corned beef the day prior, place in the cooler with a heavy weight on top and the next day, any grains of heavy fat intermingled throughout the meat would be squeezed out yielding a less fatty looking slice. To do this at home and to show the difference, I cut the cooked roast in half and left one un-pressed and pressed the other by putting a second sheet pan over the top and topping with a heavy Dutch oven filled with some water. That whole set up is then placed in the refrigerator overnight. This step is not totally necessary but I wanted to show the difference. Once the meat is hot, you really can't see the fat and as a bonus, fat tastes good. So this is your choice here..",

You of course won't be doing that, unless you want to of course, so just use this as a timing guide. Below I list each vegetable with how to prepare and the exact time to cook.",

Remove any discolored outer leaves and cut the cabbage in half through the center of the core. Then cut each half in half keeping the core intact for each piece. Finally cut each quarter in half again keeping core attached to each wedge. Place in boiling liquid. The liquid will take about eight minutes to come back to a boil and only about four or five additional minutes to cook.", 
            "Potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut in quarters if large or thirds or halves if small. Place in boiling liquid. The liquid will take two minutes to come back to a boil and 15 minutes to cook.", 
            "Onions: Cut top and bottom off and peel but leave whole. If you cut them, they fall apart and are hard to fish out after. Place in boiling liquid and cook for 25 minutes including the time it takes to come back to a boil.", 
            "Parsnips: Cut off ends and cut on the bias into uniform sized pieces. They should be large enough to be more than a mouthful but not left whole. Place in boiling liquid and cook about 8 minutes including time to come back to a boil.", 
            "Turnip: Cut off both ends and peel completely down to white or yellow meat. Make sure all skin and green inner lining is peeled off. Cut into 2-3 inch chunks and place into boiling liquid. Cook for 15-18 minutes including time to come back to a boil.", 
            "Yellow or orange beets (not red): Peel and quarter. Place in boiling water and cook for 15 minutes including time to come back to a boil.", 
            "Carrots: Peel, cut ends off and cut into similar size and shape as parsnips. Place in boiling water and cook for ten minutes including time for liquid to come back to a boil.", 
            "If cooking all vegetables in the same pot, the order would be as follows: onions, potatoes, turnip, beets, cabbage, carrots and parsnips, letting each cook for a bit before adding the next. I prefer cooking each separately, but only because I am very finicky about over cooked vegetables and I like serving them separate to give dinner guests or family the chance to select what they want.", 
            "At this point, you can refrigerate everything including the rest of the liquid and get back at it just before dinner that day or the next day. There should be two quarts of liquid left. If you have less, just add enough water to bring it back to two quarts.",

Bring the heat to a medium flame with both burners and gently heat the vegetables back up. This will take 15-20 minutes to heat them through. Keep covered so no moisture escapes.", 
            "Here is another great tip. By now you were probably wondering what the corn starch was for. Basically we are going to make a glaze to heat the meat and serve over the vegetables as they are served. The glaze gives everything a nice tasty glisten and is great to sop up with bread.",

(This is the bone across the bottom that holds each chop together.) Save that bone for the stock. Next remove the smaller end of the roast by running the knife down between two bones so you are left with one large roast with four bones and the rest that you removed.", 
            "On the small piece of roast you removed, the bones and some of the meat will be used for stock. The remaining meat can be frozen for another meal and would make a great boneless pork chop dinner.", 
            "Run a sharp knife down and around to each bone tip of the larger piece and remove the meat. Set aside for the stock. Then take a sharp paring knife and scrape each bone in a downward motion down to the loin. Remove those pieces also for stock.", 
            "With a very sharp long knife, start running the knife flat between the bones and the loin, and go to within an inch of the bottom. Flatten this out by pulling the meat flap one way and the bones the other. Now run the knife again into the fat meat of the loin starting from the bone side and going to within an inch of the end and fold this open. The roast should now be butterflied. Set this aside while you work on the stock and the stuffing. We will get back to this.",

Cover with water to within an inch of the top and bring to a boil. Reduce to a fast simmer and cook 1 1/2 hours while you prepare the remaining recipe. You should finish with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of reduced stock after discarding solids. Place the liquid back into the pan and add the gravy color and heat back to hot.", 
            "In a small saute pan, melt butter over medium heat and add flour. Stir and cook for four minutes then remove from heat and cool slightly. Add a little at a time to the stock to form gravy. Once at the desired thickness stir and remove from heat. You may or may not use all of the butter and flour mixture. Set aside.",

            "In a large pot or Dutch oven, place raw corned beef and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, shut off burner and discard liquid. This will lower the saltiness of the finished meat. Refill with clean water, add carrot pieces, one of the onions cut in half, one cleaned leek, tops removed and cut in half the long way, the celery pieces and the peppercorns. Bring back to a boil, cover partially and simmer for three hours. Check every hour and if too much water has evaporated, add more water. The liquid will be discarded at the end so just keep the meat covered with water during cooking. After three hours, discard liquid and vegetables and cool meat. This step can be done a day ahead.", 
            "Cook bacon until crisp. Reserve bacon fat and set aside the cooked bacon.", 
            "Place both diced potatoes into a pot and cover with water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil then shut off burner and let potatoes sit in hot water for ten minutes. Drain and set aside.", 
            "Dice second onion and white part of second leek to 1/2 inch dice. Place butter and one tablespoon of bacon fat in medium frying pan and place onions and leeks and saute on medium for four to five minutes until the onions are translucent. Remove from heat.", 
            "In a large bowl, rough mash both potatoes with a potato masher (Do not over mash). Add cooked onions and leeks. Add garlic powder, parsley, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, nutmeg and mix.", 
            "On a cutting board, trim corned beef of top layer of fat then slice against the grain into thick one inch slices. Then with your hands, break up each slice into small to medium sized pieces and add to the bowl with the other ingredients. Mix until thoroughly combined. Because you are using corned beef (which can be salty), only add salt at this point if the mixture needs it. Let this mixture sit under refrigeration for an hour to blend flavors. At this point, you could freeze half and continue if you are making this for four instead of eight.", 
            "In a cast iron skillet or heavy bottomed pan over medium to medium high heat, add two tablespoons of the bacon fat until hot and the bowl of hash mixture (If your pan is not large enough, you may need to do this in two batches). Using a strong spatula, press mixture firmly down into the pan. Cook for five minutes or more to brown bottom and remove from burner (sneak a peek under one edge to make sure it is not getting overly browned). Make sure sides are not sticking and place a large plate, platter or cookie sheet over the pan and with caution, flip hash over onto plate or pan. Place fry pan back on the heat, add one more tablespoon of bacon fat until hot. Slide hash back into pan. At this point, don't fret if it's not perfect, after all this is hash and it is OK if the surface is not perfectly even and browned. While hash is browning on the second side, in a medium skillet with one tablespoon of bacon fat, cook four to eight eggs (one per person) to over easy or your preference.", 
            "To serve, divide into four to eight portions, slide a spatula under each portion and slip onto a serving dish. Place a cooked egg over each portion. We served ours with a cooked buttered English muffin and a nice hot cup of steaming coffee."

            "If using fresh tomatoes: The skins of plum tomatoes cook down enough in this soup so that you don't need to peel them but you do need to remove the seeds as they will make the soup bitter. The easiest method is to have two bowls, one with a strainer. If you are using plum tomatoes, nip off the end and cut in half lengthwise. Then with your thumb or index finger, scrape the seeds from each half into the bowl with the strainer. If cutting larger round tomatoes, cut out core and cut them horizontally. Then over the bowl with the strainer, reach up and scrape out all the seeds. Throw the cleaned tomatoes into the bowl without the strainer. Finally move the seeds around the strainer to get out any last bit of juice and discard seeds. Take the liquid left in the bowl and add to the tomato halves. With three pounds of tomatoes, you should end up with a little over 2 pounds of cut up tomatoes (weighed on a scale). This is equal to about six to eight cups (a little more or less is fine).",
